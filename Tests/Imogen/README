(I)Notes:-

This directory contains 4 subdirectories and 1 compilation file "build.sh"

1) Sub-directory "cuda_src" contains source code for benchmarking GeMTC.
   Files inside "cuda_src" are :-
   a) ArrayAtomicTest.cu:-
      It contains Benchmarking code for Imogen's ported kernel from "gpuImogen/gpuclass/cudaArrayAtomic.cu"
      The corresponding Kernel file is "gemtc/Kernels/ArrayAtomic.cu"
          Purpose of "gemtc/Kernels/ArrayAtomic.cu":- 
          To perform operation on single array. Useful when parameters like density
          are required to be kept to have certain minimum value or certain maximum value
          or require NaNs to be replaced by zeros.

   b) ArrayRotateTest.cu:-
      It contains Benchmarking code for Imogen's ported kernel from "gpuImogen/gpuclass/cudaArrayRotate.cu"
      The corresponding Kernel file is "gemtc/Kernels/ArrayRotate.cu"
          Purpose of "gemtc/Kernels/ArrayRotate.cu":-
          To perform array rotation

   c) FluidTVDTest.cu:-
      It contains Benchmarking code for Imogen's ported cukern_TVDStep_hydro_uniform() kernel from "gpuImogen/gpuclass/cudaFluidTVD.cu"
      The corresponding Kernel file is "gemtc/Kernels/FluidTVD.cu"
          Purpose of "gemtc/Kernels/FluidTVD.cu":-
          It implements Cuda Fluid TVD function. It takes a single forward-time step, CFD  of the conserved-transport
          part of the fluid equations using a total variation diminishing scheme to perform a non-oscillatory update. We
          migrated only purehyro kernel, hence magnetic parameters are all 0.

   d) FluidWTest.cu:-
      It contains Benchmarking code for Imogen's ported cukern_Wstep_hydro_uniform() kernel from "gpuImogen/gpuclass/cudaFluidW.cu"
      The corresponding Kernel file is "gemtc/Kernels/FluidW.cu"
          Purpose of "gemtc/Kernels/FluidW.cu":-
          This function calculates a first order accurate half-step of the conserved transport part of the fluid equations (CFD)
          which is used as the predictor input to the matching TVD function. The kernel implemented is purehydro implying magnetic
          parameters are zero.

   e) freezeAndPtotTest.cu:-
      It contains Benchmarking code for Imogen's ported cukern_FreezeSpeed_hydro() kernel from "gpuImogen/gpuclass/freezeAndPtot.cu"
      The corresponding Kernel file is "gemtc/Kernels/freezeAndPtot.cu"
          Purpose of "gemtc/Kernels/freezeAndPtot.cu":-
          This function is used to derive pressure and freeze parameters to enforce minimum pressure

   f) Pi.cu:-
      It is NOT an Imogen application but was built for demo purpose.
      The corresponding Kernel file is "gemtc/Kernels/Pi.cu"
          Purpose of "gemtc/Kernels/Pi.cu":-
          xiProgram to compute Pi using Monte Carlo method.

   g) memory_bugger.cu:-
      It is NOT an Imogen application bust was built to find the GeMTC memory leak bug.
      There is NO kernel file for it.

2) Sub-directory "host_src" contains host code for all kernels in cuda_src with same file name.
   Purpose is for comparing comparision gemtc benchmark with host equivalent.

3) Sub-directory "gemtc_imogen_bin" is the directory where "build.sh" will genetate binaries for "cuda_src"

4) Sub-directory "host_bin" is the directory where "build.sh" will genetate binaries for "host_src"

5) Sub-directory "data' contains data inputs for "FluidTVDTest.cu" all other have the data genetator function inbuilt inside the benchmarking program.

(II)COMPILING:-
  Run ./build.sh
=====================================================================================================================================================


(III)EXECUTING:-
=====================================================================================================================================================
  Goto respective bin directory "emtc_imogen_bin" or "host_bin"
and run ./<program_name> it will pop further usage guidance.

For example:-
[dgahlot@jarvis Imogen]$ cd gemtc_imogen_bin
[dgahlot@jarvis gemtc_imogen_bin]$ ./ArrayAtomicTest
This test requires three parameters:
int NUM_TASKS, int LOOP_SIZE, int ARRAY_SIZE
where
NUM_TASKS is the total number ArrayAtomic tasks to be sent to gemtc
LOOP_SIZE is the number of tasks should be sent to gemtc before waiting for results
ARRAY_SIZE is the side length of the matrix that is going to be squared
