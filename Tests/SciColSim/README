SciColSim:-

Notes:-
There are 4 modified files for porting expensive function inside GeMTC.
1) build.sh
   This file contains the inclusion of gemtc shared object file while compiling SciColSim.

2) optimizer.cpp
   This file contains the modifed update_probabilities_all_visible() to make push task to
   gemtc.

3) optimizer-multi-loss.cpp
   This file contains the gemtcSetup() call.

4) test-annealing-exm.sh
   This file contains modified launch parameters to make scicolsim run with GeMTC.

How to run scicolsim:-
======================
I want ot avoid unnecessary wastage of space by uploading "scicolsim-2013-03-07.tar.gz" inside gemtc git

Hence only relavant files are present in gemtc's SciColSim folder.

Here are the steps:-
1) Download gemtc from git repository.

2) Choose the kernel you wish to simulate inside Kernels directory.
   a) File name of the kernel must be "SciColSim.cu" which will get compiled by gemtc's build.sh
   b) By default SciColSim.cu contains 1 warp kernel
   c) SciColSim_Single.cu contains code for 1 thread execution.
   d) By default 1 warp kernel will be compiled.
   e) To use 1 thread kernel follow the instructions in "SciColSim_Single.cu".

3) Build gemtc with "build.sh" in gemtc root directory.

4) Copy "scicolsim-2013-03-07.tar.gz" from "https://sites.google.com/site/gemtcproject/applications/scicolsim?pli=1"

5) Unpackage scicolsim-2013-03-07.tar.gz inside "gemtc/Tests"

6) Copy the files from this directory to "gemtc/Tests/scicolsim-2013-03-07" in following manner:-
   a) Copy build.sh into "gemtc/Tests/scicolsim-2013-03-07/"
   b) Copy test-annealing-exm.sh into "gemtc/Tests/scicolsim-2013-03-07/"
   c) Copy optimizer.cpp into "gemtc/Tests/scicolsim-2013-03-07/src/optimizer.cpp"
   d) Copy optimizer-multi-loss.cpp into "gemtc/Tests/scicolsim-2013-03-07/src"
  
7) Goto "gemtc/Tests/scicolsim-2013-03-07/" 

8) Run ./getboost.sh

9) Compile scicolsim by ./build.sh

10) Test scicolsim by running ./test-annealing-exm.sh

11) Reults will appear in "gemtc/Tests/scicolsim-2013-03-07/test" directory
