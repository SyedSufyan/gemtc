  * MDProxy (get this up and running through whole stack fast)
  * performance, get new micro-kernels running on Raven (where are we performance-wise as of SC)
  * yadu, ex-search, exaustive search, svn on midway, lung search (talk to yadu about new app)
  * john grime, cg(corse grain)-engine, multi-scale (try out md code from grime)
  * http://cmts.uchicago.edu/
