    abstract = {{Recent distributed computing frameworks--such as MapReduce, Hadoop and Dryad--have made it simple to exploit multiple machines in a compute cloud. However, these frameworks use coordination languages that are insufficiently expressive for many classes of computation, including iterative and recursive algorithms. To address this problem, and generalise previous approaches, we introduce Skywriting: a Turing-powerful, purely-functional script language for describing distributed computations. In this paper, we introduce the main features of Skywriting, and outline our novel cooperative task farming execution engine.}},

  abstract = {For the software industry to take advantage of multicore processors, we must allow programmers to arbitrarily compose parallel libraries without sacrificing performance. We argue that high-level task or thread abstractions and a common global scheduler cannot provide effective library composition. Instead, the operating system should expose unvirtualized processing resources that can be shared cooperatively between parallel libraries within an application. In this paper, we describe a system that standardizes and facilitates the exchange of these unvirtualized processing resources between libraries.}
